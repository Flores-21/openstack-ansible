    Due to OSSA-2023-003, value of ``openstack_service_token_roles_required``
    has been changed to ``true``.
    With that, major upgrades to Yoga release might struggle from prolonged
    dowtimes.
    Sensetive to API downtime environments can perform major upgrade to
    any prior release with subsequent minor upgrade that will enable
    ``openstack_service_token_roles_required`` and install safe versions
    of services. Other way around would be to manually create and assign
    ``service`` role to all "service" users.
